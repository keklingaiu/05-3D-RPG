# Bullseye Island (05-3D-RPG)
Game developed for MSCH-C220, 30 November 2020.

Welcome to Bullseye Island, a 3D space where you must talk to the traveler, and then work your way around the map to find and destroy all the targets. Once you have done this, destroy the enemy drone and secure the win! However, be sure to be careful... you only have a limited time to do this in.
